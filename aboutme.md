### Hi, I'm Yewon Kim 👋


Welcome to my little blog! I have been learning architecture at Seoul National University since 2019. And lately, I'm getting into web design, participating various design-related activities. If you want to know more about me, please stay tuned for my blogging activities. Or if you want to get a quick look at the official information of me, look up the CV in the information tab at the top.
